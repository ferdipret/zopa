# ReactJS Coding Challenge - Zopa - Solution

1. Start the server by running `npm run start:server` or `yarn start:server`

2. Start the app by running `npm run start` or `yarn start`

3. Open up your browser and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

I've add header to avoid any CORS conflicts.

Lastly I didn't have time to show validation on the input fields, however the
form won't submit if the fields do not contain some content.

**Thank you, and I hope you like the app!**
