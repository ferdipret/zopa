# ReactJS Coding Challenge - Zopa - Solution

1. Start the server by running `npm run start:server` or `yarn start:server`

2. Start the app by running `npm run start` or `yarn start`

3. Open up your browser and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

I've added headers to avoid any CORS conflicts.

Lastly I didn't have time to show validation on the input fields, however the
form won't submit if the fields do not contain some content. The input component
also takes an `error` prop as a boolean value to display the error state, and
`helperText` as a string or an array of strings to display any error messages.
